            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>This project focuses on analyzing a dataset from a business context, using SQL queries to extract meaningful insights. 
                The dataset includes sales data, customer details, and product information. 
                The analysis involves aggregating sales by region, identifying the most popular products, and understanding customer purchasing patterns.</p>

        <h2>SQL Queries</h2>
            <p>Below are the SQL queries used to analyze the dataset, covering total sales by region, customer purchases, product popularity, and other business metrics.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-sql">
-- Total sales by region
SELECT C.Region, SUM(P.UnitPrice * S.Quantity) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales S
JOIN Customers C ON S.CustomerID = C.CustomerID
JOIN Products P ON S.ProductID = P.ProductID
GROUP BY C.Region;

-- Customer with the highest number of purchases
SELECT C.CustomerName, SUM(S.Quantity) AS TotalPurchases
FROM Sales S
JOIN Customers C ON S.CustomerID = C.CustomerID
GROUP BY C.CustomerName
ORDER BY TotalPurchases DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Most popular product by quantity sold
SELECT P.ProductName, SUM(S.Quantity) AS TotalSold
FROM Sales S
JOIN Products P ON S.ProductID = P.ProductID
GROUP BY P.ProductName
ORDER BY TotalSold DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Average age of customers who bought 'Product A'
SELECT AVG(C.Age) AS AvgAge
FROM Sales S
JOIN Customers C ON S.CustomerID = C.CustomerID
JOIN Products P ON S.ProductID = P.ProductID

-- Sales breakdown by product category
SELECT P.Category, SUM(P.UnitPrice * S.Quantity) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales S
JOIN Products P ON S.ProductID = P.ProductID

-- Customers who have purchased more than a certain quantity of products
SELECT c.customer_name, SUM(s.quantity) AS total_quantity_purchased

GROUP BY c.customer_name
HAVING SUM(s.quantity) > 5;
